# WebSiteImageScraper
Enter a board, set your download location and enjoy. 
This piece of software is mainly to used with 4chan in mind, but can be adapted with any forum in mind. It is intended
to be pointed at a board, and it will download all pictures for that board (vg, co, etc). The software has gif and webm support
through direct stream copying. This project features a GUI for setting the root directory, while all other interaction is through cmd line.

*If you decide to download into a single folder, the directory will look like RootDir(user set) -> image
*If you decide to download to multiple folders, directory will look like RootDir(user set) - > file (named after the thread being parsed) -> image
